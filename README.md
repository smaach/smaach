### Assesing the efficacy of Renewable Energy Policies post Kyoto-Protocol (Master's Thesis)

1. Research Problem -

   Identifying the implication of 5 different Green Energy policies after and before Kyoto Protocol on development of Green Energy and on reduction of CO2   emissions across 40 countries around the world from 2000 to 2020.

2. Data -

   Sourced the socioeconomic data from *[World Data Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/)*, energy related data from *[International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/)* and *[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)*. The data was cleaned, modified, transformed in R using *dplyr and tidyr*.

3. Methodology -

   Implemented a difference-in-differences econometric study using Ordinary Least Square Regression to account for 10 socio-economics factors facilatating in the study as regressors. The study incorporated microecomic panel-data and undertook rigourous testing to validate the data.

4. Results -
   
     The results were answered both in terms of Carbon Dioxide emissions and Green Energy Development, in summary, the findings indicate that Feed-in Tariffs, Tradable Green Certificates (TGC), and Tax Rebates help in increasing the share of renewable energy, whereas Subsidies and Auction-based Tenders exert a negative significant effect. Additionally, Subsidies, Auction-based Tenders, and TGC are effective in reducing GHG emissions, whereas other policies do not show significant effects.

   
   

<p> Researched 5 different types of Green Energy Policies - Feed-in Tarrifs, Tenders, Tradable Green Certificates, Subsidies, Tax Rebates and their implication on boosting Green Energy Development particularly Solar, Wind and Hydro Energy.
