## Projects

### 1. Evaluating Renewable Energy Policies in the Post–Kyoto Protocol Era *(Master’s Thesis)*

**Overview**  
Analyzed the impact of five renewable energy policies on:
- Growth in renewable energy adoption  
- Reduction in CO₂ emissions  

Compared outcomes before and after the Kyoto Protocol, using panel data for 60 countries from 2000–2020.

**Data Sources**
- Socioeconomic data — [World Data Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/)  
- Energy data — [International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/), [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)  

Data processing performed in **R** using `dplyr` and `tidyr`.

**Methodology**
- Approach: Difference-in-Differences (DiD)  
- Model: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression  
- Controls: 10 socioeconomic variables  
- Validation: Extensive robustness tests on panel microeconomic data  

**Key Findings**

| Impact Area               | Positive Policy Impact                                 | Negative/No Impact                               |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Renewable Energy Share    | Feed-in Tariffs, Tradable Green Certificates (TGC), Tax Rebates | Subsidies, Auction-based Tenders                 |
| CO₂ Emissions Reduction   | Subsidies, Auction-based Tenders, TGC                  | Feed-in Tariffs, Tax Rebates (no significant effect) |

**Project Details**
- Tech Stack: Python, R, LaTeX  
- Skills: Research, documentation, panel data analysis, policy evaluation
