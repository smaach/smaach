## Projects

### Assesing the efficacy of Renewable Energy Policies post Kyoto-Protocol (Master's Thesis)

1. Research Problem -

   Identifying the implication of 5 different Green Energy policies after and before Kyoto Protocol on development of Green Energy and on reduction of CO2   emissions across 40 countries around the world from 2000 to 2020.

2. Data -

   Sourced the socioeconomic data from *[World Data Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/)*, energy related data from *[International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/)* and *[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)*. The data was cleaned, modified, transformed in R using *dplyr and tidyr*. The final data consisted of 60 countries in the form of a panel from 2000 to 2020.

3. Methodology -

   Implemented a difference-in-differences econometric study using Ordinary Least Square Regression to account for 10 socio-economics factors facilatating in the study as regressors. The study incorporated microecomic panel-data and undertook rigourous testing to validate the data.

4. Results -
   
     The results were answered both in terms of Carbon Dioxide emissions and Green Energy Development, in summary, the findings indicate that Feed-in Tariffs, Tradable Green Certificates (TGC), and Tax Rebates help in increasing the share of renewable energy, whereas Subsidies and Auction-based Tenders exert a negative significant effect. Additionally, Subsidies, Auction-based Tenders, and TGC are effective in reducing GHG emissions, whereas other policies do not show significant effects.

- Tech Stack: Python, R, Latex
- Skills Learned: Research, Documentation, Panel Data Analysis, Policy Evaluation

### Yahoo Finance Data Ingestion Pipeline with AI-Powered Query Interface

- Engineered a modular ETL pipeline in Python leveraging yfinance for market data extraction, pandas for data transformation, and SQLAlchemy for ORM-based integration with PostgreSQL, ensuring scalable and maintainable ingestion of stock prices, income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow reports.
- Designed and implemented a normalized relational database schema with indexed tables to optimize query performance, enforce data integrity, and support analytical workloads on large-scale financial datasets.
- Developed an AI-assisted financial data exploration tool using Streamlit, integrated with LangChain and OpenAI API, enabling natural-language-to-SQL translation for dynamic querying and real-time visualization of database results.
